# GOACS2 Python Modules and Packages

In this assignment, you will import a **Python package** called `pygamezero` to help you run some sample code.  
  
You will also create a `main.py` program as described in the Canvas assignment. See the assignment page for additional instructions.

Instructions for importing packages are below. The most important steps are <ins>underlined</ins>.


> 1. <ins>Open the Terminal</ins>
>     * At the top of the VSCode window, you'll see the Terminal menu in the menu bar. 
Choose `New Terminal` from the menu, or use the shortcut `Ctrl` + `Shift` + \` on Windows or `command` + `shift` + \`on Mac
> 2. Install the required package(s)
>     * <ins>In the Terminal, type `pip install pgzero`</ins>
>     * Pygame Zero is the package used in this sample program.
>     * IF THIS DOESN'T WORK - please try the following:
>       * upgrade pip using the following command: `pip install --upgrade pip` and try `pip install pgzero` again.
>       * use pip3 instead of pip, for example `pip3 install pgzero`
> 3. Choose your Interpreter
>     * If VS Code still doesn't recognize the import pgzrun code at the top of the program, we will have to determine which interpreter has Pygame Zero installed.
>     * <ins>At the bottom of VS Code is a version of Python. Click on this, then choose the version of Python interpreter where the package was installed.</ins> You'll know you've chosen the right one when VS Code recognizes the pgzrun module.
> 4. Run the program
>     * Select the `pgzerosample.py` file in the explorer
>         * If you don't see the file list, click on the icon on the top left of the window
>     * Click the play button on the top right of the window
